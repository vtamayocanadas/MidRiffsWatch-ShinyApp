# MidRiffsWatch-ShinyApp
App Summary
This App will provide users with a two scenario world in the mid-Gulf of California: one scenario where there are no Marine Reserves and one with 5% of the area protected as a net of Marine Reserves. The App will provide information on 13 fisheries that account for approximately 90% catch in the region. Using the model developed by the Midriff Watch Group Project Team, users will be able to visualize both observational data from 2005 to 2015, and projected outputs up to 2105. They will have the option to choose from biomass and revenues from catch, derived from those fisheries. All outputs will allow users to compare two scenarios: Marine Reserves implemented, and Marine Reserves not implemented.

Data Summary
1. Variables (4): Biomass (metric tons), Catch (metric tons), Revenues (millions of dollars)

2. 13 fisheries, catch data for each variable from 2005 - 2015, and projected outcomes 100 years into the future.

3. The database has been cleaned up and organized, but still needs some work to be in the tidy format necessary for making the App.

Widgets 
1. Dropdown menu: Users will select one of the thirteen fisheries they are interested in with the dropdown menu. There is data on all three variables for each fisheries.

2. Radio Buttons: There will be one button each for the four variables: revenues, catch, and biomass. This will be the way users select which dependent variable they would like to use for the output figures (y axis). 

3.  Slider: The user will select the time period they are interested in up to 100 years into the future. This will appear on the x axis of the output figure. The slider will start at 2015, and end at 2105.

Note: In the final form of the app, to be completed Spring 2019, there will also be buttons for users to download the raw data used for the project, and to view a .pdf of the full report. Users would be able to run their own scenario also.

Outputs
Outputs for years between 2005 and 2015 are from observational data. Outputs for years past 2015 will be projected values based on the model developed by the Midriff Watch Group Project Team. There are two scenarios: the Mexican government implements a Marine Reserve in the Mid-Gulf of California, and they do not implement a Marine Reserve.
 
The outputs generated by the widget selections will be line graphs of the selected variable versus time (for the species they selected). Each will have two lines: one representing the scenario where Marine Reserves were implemented, one representing the scenario where Marine Reserves were not implemented (Business as usual BAU).
