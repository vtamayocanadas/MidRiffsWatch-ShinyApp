Graphs:
1. Time series of catched with overlaid estimate of MSY (solid line) and and 95% limit (dashed lines)
2. Point plot of plausible k versus r values, dots show r-k combinations that are compatible with catch series
3. Histogram of plausible r values, posterior densities distribution
4. Histogram of plausible k values, posterior densities distribution
5. Histogram of M values, posterior densities distribution
6. Histogram of MSY from plausible values of l0,k,r, and Bmsy/k 
7. Histogram of Bmsy from plausible values of l0,k,r, and Bmsy/k
8. Histogram of Fmsy from plausible values of l0,k,r, and Bmsy/k; fishing mortality at MSY is r/2
9. Histogram of Umsy values from Fmsy and M; Umsy is exploitation rate at MSY
10. Histogram of overfishing limit (OFL) in last year+1 values from Umsys
11. Line plots of accepted and rejected biomass trajectores with median and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles (in red)
